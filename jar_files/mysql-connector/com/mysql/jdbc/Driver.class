I watched the so hyped 'Suicide Squad' today and man oh man, it is absolutely ravishing. From the very first scene till the credits rolled, the movie was a roller coaster of uber action, emotions and amazing character transformations. The comic book based flick had loads of pressure of delivering and living up to the expectations of crazy fans and indifferent critics. However, It was not able to suffice the latter, for which nobody is to be blamed. Apparently rotten tomatoes doesn't hate DC as their ratings come from aggregation of reviews from various newspaper and websites. The fact might not be digestible because that would suggest that media, as a whole, intricately is somehow disagreeing with the work of DC. But that all might just change with the launch of this offbeat cinematic story of Bad vs Evil. The story is pretty simple to fathom. Since always lurking evil finds a new way to rise in Midway city (centered in BVS timeline), mean Amanda Waller, brilliantly played by Viola Davis, who is a high government official takes up the herculean task of creating a team of maniacs, cons and metahumans to hit evil back to the ground. The character execution by Will Smith, Margot Robbie and fellow actors will seriously convince you to sit tight till the very end. Joker, played by the Oscar winner Jared Leto, goes hand in hand with her on screen love interest Harley Quinn, to which Margot Robbie has done justice to. Their chemistry is off the hook. There were few scenes which slowed the execution of the movie (first few scenes from the second half) but it picked up the pace gradually. The mix of comedy and despair can be scene when Captain Boomerang(Jai Courtney) and Deadshot(Will Smith) get screen time. All things considered this movie can mark the work of David Ayer (Director) in History, when in the first time ever Antiheroes take the stand as Protagonist to ward off evil from the face of the earth. At the end of the day DC can finally take a sigh of relief as Suicide Squad puts them back on the map.
